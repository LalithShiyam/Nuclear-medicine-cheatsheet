## Basic Principles
### Definition:
#### 📌 **Nuclear Medicine:** 
- A branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses radioactive substances (radiopharmaceuticals) for diagnosis, treatment, and research.

### 📌 **Radiopharmaceuticals:**
- **What are they?** 
  - **Radiopharmaceutical** = 💊 (Pharmaceutical) + ☢️ (Radioactive Isotope)
- **Purpose:** 
  - Radiopharmaceuticals are taken up by specific organs, tissues, or cells, allowing them to be visualized during imaging or to deliver therapeutic radiation to targeted sites.

## Types of Radiation


### 🔵 Alpha Radiation (α):

**General Characteristics:**

- 📌 Composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.
- 🧲 Positively charged.
- 🚧 Short range in tissues and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or human skin.

**Common Alpha Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

- **Radium-223 (Ra-223)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Treatment of bone metastases in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** Undergoes a series of alpha decays to become stable lead.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** The emitted alpha particles are high linear energy transfer (LET) particles, meaning they can cause a significant amount of local damage, making them useful for targeted therapy of metastatic lesions in bones.

### 🔴 Beta Radiation (β):

**General Characteristics:**

- ➖ Beta Minus (β-) involves emission of electrons.
- ➕ Beta Plus (β+) involves emission of positrons.
- 🚀 Longer range than alpha particles but less than gamma rays.

**Common Beta Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

- **Yttrium-90 (Y-90)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Used in radioimmunotherapy and for liver cancer treatments using microspheres.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** β- emitter that decays to stable Zirconium-90.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Due to its relatively long half-life and pure beta emission, it delivers a high dose of radiation to targeted tissues.
  
- **Fluorine-18 (F-18)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Most commonly used in FDG-PET imaging for oncology.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** β+ emitter that decays into Oxygen-18.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Provides valuable metabolic information about tissues, with tumors typically showing increased FDG uptake due to higher metabolic activity.

### 🌌 Gamma Radiation (γ):

**General Characteristics:**

- 💡 Electromagnetic radiation (high-energy photons).
- 🛡️ Deeply penetrating and requires shielding.

**Common Gamma Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

- **Technetium-99m (Tc-99m)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** The most widely used radionuclide in diagnostic nuclear medicine. Used in a variety of scans such as bone scans, myocardial perfusion imaging, and renal scans.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** Emits gamma radiation and decays to stable Technetium-99.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Its 6-hour half-life is long enough to conduct the necessary diagnostic tests but short enough to minimize radiation dose to the patient. The emitted gamma energy (140 keV) is ideal for imaging with a gamma camera.
  
- **Iodine-131 (I-131)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Used for both diagnostic imaging and therapy, particularly for thyroid diseases.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** Beta and gamma emitter.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Accumulates in the thyroid gland, allowing imaging or targeted destruction of thyroid tissue.

## Imaging Techniques
- **Gamma Camera**: Captures gamma rays from radiopharmaceuticals.
- **SPECT**: Provides 3D images by rotating the gamma camera.
- **PET**: Uses positron-emitting radionuclides to give metabolic information and high-resolution images.
- **Hybrid Imaging**: Techniques like PET/CT and SPECT/CT that combine anatomical and functional imaging.
