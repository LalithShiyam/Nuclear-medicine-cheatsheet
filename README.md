## Basic Principles
### Definition:
#### 📌 **Nuclear Medicine:** 
- A branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses radioactive substances (radiopharmaceuticals) for diagnosis, treatment, and research.

### 📌 **Radiopharmaceuticals:**
- **What are they?** 
  - **Radiopharmaceutical** = 💊 (Pharmaceutical) + ☢️ (Radioactive Isotope)
- **Purpose:** 
  - Radiopharmaceuticals are taken up by specific organs, tissues, or cells, allowing them to be visualized during imaging or to deliver therapeutic radiation to targeted sites.

## Types of Radiation


### 🔵 Alpha Radiation (α):

**General Characteristics:**

- 📌 Composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.
- 🧲 Positively charged.
- 🚧 Short range in tissues and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or human skin.

**Common Alpha Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

- **Radium-223 (Ra-223)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Treatment of bone metastases in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** Undergoes a series of alpha decays to become stable lead.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** The emitted alpha particles are high linear energy transfer (LET) particles, meaning they can cause a significant amount of local damage, making them useful for targeted therapy of metastatic lesions in bones.

### 🔴 Beta Radiation (β):

**General Characteristics:**

- ➖ Beta Minus (β-) involves emission of electrons.
- ➕ Beta Plus (β+) involves emission of positrons.
- 🚀 Longer range than alpha particles but less than gamma rays.

**Common Beta Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

- **Yttrium-90 (Y-90)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Used in radioimmunotherapy and for liver cancer treatments using microspheres.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** β- emitter that decays to stable Zirconium-90.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Due to its relatively long half-life and pure beta emission, it delivers a high dose of radiation to targeted tissues.
  
- **Fluorine-18 (F-18)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Most commonly used in FDG-PET imaging for oncology.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** β+ emitter that decays into Oxygen-18.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Provides valuable metabolic information about tissues, with tumors typically showing increased FDG uptake due to higher metabolic activity.

### 🌌 Gamma Radiation (γ):

**General Characteristics:**

- 💡 Electromagnetic radiation (high-energy photons).
- 🛡️ Deeply penetrating and requires shielding.

**Common Gamma Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

- **Technetium-99m (Tc-99m)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** The most widely used radionuclide in diagnostic nuclear medicine. Used in a variety of scans such as bone scans, myocardial perfusion imaging, and renal scans.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** Emits gamma radiation and decays to stable Technetium-99.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Its 6-hour half-life is long enough to conduct the necessary diagnostic tests but short enough to minimize radiation dose to the patient. The emitted gamma energy (140 keV) is ideal for imaging with a gamma camera.
  
- **Iodine-131 (I-131)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Used for both diagnostic imaging and therapy, particularly for thyroid diseases.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** Beta and gamma emitter.
  - 🎯 **Why Used:** Accumulates in the thyroid gland, allowing imaging or targeted destruction of thyroid tissue.

## Imaging Techniques 📸


### 1. **Gamma Camera** 📸

- **Principle**: A gamma camera captures gamma radiation from radiopharmaceuticals inside a patient's body, thereby providing a two-dimensional image.

- **Components**:
    - 🌀 **Collimator**: A lead shield with holes that only allows gamma rays traveling in specific directions to pass through, ensuring spatial resolution.
    - 🎛 **Detector Crystal**: Typically made of sodium iodide or cesium iodide, this crystal emits flashes of light (scintillations) when hit by gamma rays.
    - 🖥 **Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs)**: Positioned behind the crystal, these tubes detect the light from the crystal and convert it into an electrical signal.
    - 🔍 **Computer System**: Takes the signals from the PMTs and constructs an image.

- **Operation**: After a patient is administered a radiopharmaceutical, the gamma camera captures emitted gamma rays, and a computer processes this data into an image.

- **Indications**:
    - Bone Scans: Detect bone metastases, fractures, infections, or inflammatory disorders.
    - Thyroid Scans: Evaluate thyroid function or detect tumors.
    - Renal Scans: Assess kidney function and drainage.
    - Cardiac Stress Tests: Determine areas of low blood flow.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Technetium-99m (Tc-99m): Versatile and can be combined with various molecules to target specific organs.
    - Iodine-123 (I-123): Common for thyroid scans.

### 2. **SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)** 🔄

- **How it Functions**: A SPECT scanner acquires multiple 2D images from various angles. A computer then uses these images to produce a 3D image, providing more detail about the body's internal structures.

- **Clinical Applications**: 
    - Brain: Analyze blood flow and detect abnormalities.
    - Heart: Detect coronary artery disease or myocardial infarctions.
    - Bones: Spot fractures, infections, or tumors.

- **Advantages over Planar Imaging**:
    - Provides 3D visualization, allowing for more accurate localization of lesions.
    - Offers better contrast resolution.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Technetium-99m (Tc-99m): Modified for various target organs, including the brain, heart, and bones.

### 3. **PET (Positron Emission Tomography)** 🌌

- **Basics of Positron Emission**: After a patient is injected with a positron-emitting radionuclide, the positron encounters an electron in the body. Their mutual annihilation produces two gamma rays, which travel in opposite directions and are captured by the PET camera.

- **Commonly Used Radionuclides**:
    - Fluorine-18 FDG (F-18 FDG): Sugar molecule analog that, when taken up by cells, indicates metabolic activity.

- **Clinical Applications**:
    - Oncology: Determine the stage of cancers, assess treatment efficacy, and detect recurrences.
    - Neurology: Diagnose conditions like Alzheimer's and evaluate epilepsy.
    - Cardiology: Evaluate perfusion and metabolism of the heart muscle.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Fluorine-18 FDG: Used in tumor imaging, highlighting areas of increased glucose metabolism.
    - Rubidium-82: Cardiac PET imaging to assess myocardial blood flow.

### 4. **Hybrid Imaging** 🌐🔗

- **Principle**: Merges anatomical (from CT or MRI) and functional (from SPECT or PET) images, allowing for enhanced diagnostic capability.

- **Techniques**:
    - **PET/CT**: Combines metabolic PET images with CT's anatomical detail, often used for cancer imaging.
    - **SPECT/CT**: Merges functional SPECT with anatomical CT, common in cardiac and orthopedic imaging.

- **Advantages**:
    - Pinpoint accuracy in lesion localization.
    - Better differentiation between benign and malignant lesions.
    - Streamlines patient management by reducing the need for multiple scans.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Vary based on the specific modality and indication. For instance, a PET/CT for cancer diagnosis might use Fluorine-18 FDG, while a SPECT/CT for cardiac imaging could utilize Technetium-99m.
