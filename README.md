## Types of Radiation


### 🔵 Alpha Radiation (α):

**General Characteristics:**

- 📌 Composed of 2 protons and 2 neutrons.
- 🧲 Positively charged.
- 🚧 Short range in tissues and can be stopped by a sheet of paper or human skin.

**Common Alpha Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

- **Radium-223 (Ra-223)**
  - 📝 **Usage:** Treatment of bone metastases in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer.
  - ⚛ **Decay Mechanism:** Undergoes a series of alpha decays to become stable lead.

### 🌌 Gamma Radiation (γ):

**General Characteristics:**

- 💡 Electromagnetic radiation (high-energy photons).
- 🛡️ Deeply penetrating and requires shielding.

**Common Gamma Emitters in Nuclear Medicine:**

## Imaging Techniques 


### 1. **Gamma Camera** 📸

- **Principle**: A gamma camera captures gamma radiation from radiopharmaceuticals inside a patient's body, thereby providing a two-dimensional image.

- **Components**:
    - 🌀 **Collimator**: A lead shield with holes that only allows gamma rays traveling in specific directions to pass through, ensuring spatial resolution.
    - 🎛 **Detector Crystal**: Typically made of sodium iodide or cesium iodide, this crystal emits flashes of light (scintillations) when hit by gamma rays.
    - 🖥 **Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs)**: Positioned behind the crystal, these tubes detect the light from the crystal and convert it into an electrical signal.
    - 🔍 **Computer System**: Takes the signals from the PMTs and constructs an image.

- **Operation**: After a patient is administered a radiopharmaceutical, the gamma camera captures emitted gamma rays, and a computer processes this data into an image.

- **Indications**:
    - Bone Scans: Detect bone metastases, fractures, infections, or inflammatory disorders.
    - Thyroid Scans: Evaluate thyroid function or detect tumors.
    - Renal Scans: Assess kidney function and drainage.
    - Cardiac Stress Tests: Determine areas of low blood flow.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Technetium-99m (Tc-99m): Versatile and can be combined with various molecules to target specific organs.
    - Iodine-123 (I-123): Common for thyroid scans.

### 2. **SPECT (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography)** 🔄

- **How it Functions**: A SPECT scanner acquires multiple 2D images from various angles. A computer then uses these images to produce a 3D image, providing more detail about the body's internal structures.

- **Clinical Applications**: 
    - Brain: Analyze blood flow and detect abnormalities.
    - Heart: Detect coronary artery disease or myocardial infarctions.
    - Bones: Spot fractures, infections, or tumors.

- **Advantages over Planar Imaging**:
    - Provides 3D visualization, allowing for more accurate localization of lesions.
    - Offers better contrast resolution.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Technetium-99m (Tc-99m): Modified for various target organs, including the brain, heart, and bones.

### 3. **PET (Positron Emission Tomography)** 🌌

- **Basics of Positron Emission**: After a patient is injected with a positron-emitting radionuclide, the positron encounters an electron in the body. Their mutual annihilation produces two gamma rays, which travel in opposite directions and are captured by the PET camera.

- **Commonly Used Radionuclides**:
    - Fluorine-18 FDG (F-18 FDG): Sugar molecule analog that, when taken up by cells, indicates metabolic activity.

- **Clinical Applications**:
    - Oncology: Determine the stage of cancers, assess treatment efficacy, and detect recurrences.
    - Neurology: Diagnose conditions like Alzheimer's and evaluate epilepsy.
    - Cardiology: Evaluate perfusion and metabolism of the heart muscle.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Fluorine-18 FDG: Used in tumor imaging, highlighting areas of increased glucose metabolism.
    - Rubidium-82: Cardiac PET imaging to assess myocardial blood flow.

### 4. **Hybrid Imaging** 🌐🔗

- **Principle**: Merges anatomical (from CT or MRI) and functional (from SPECT or PET) images, allowing for enhanced diagnostic capability.

- **Techniques**:
    - **PET/CT**: Combines metabolic PET images with CT's anatomical detail, often used for cancer imaging.
    - **SPECT/CT**: Merges functional SPECT with anatomical CT, common in cardiac and orthopedic imaging.

- **Advantages**:
    - Pinpoint accuracy in lesion localization.
    - Better differentiation between benign and malignant lesions.
    - Streamlines patient management by reducing the need for multiple scans.

- **Common Tracers**:
    - Vary based on the specific modality and indication. For instance, a PET/CT for cancer diagnosis might use Fluorine-18 FDG, while a SPECT/CT for cardiac imaging could utilize Technetium-99m.

## Radiopharmaceuticals


### 🎛 **Production of Radiopharmaceuticals**

#### **Cyclotrons in Radiopharmacy**

**What are Cyclotrons?**
In radiopharmacy, cyclotrons are particle accelerators designed to produce high-energy protons or deuterons. These particles then bombard target materials to produce specific radionuclides.

**How Do Cyclotrons Work?**
Electric fields are set up in a cyclical pattern, causing the charged particles to spiral outwards, gaining energy as they go. The high-energy particles then strike a target material, causing nuclear reactions and the production of radionuclides.

**Applications in Radiopharmacy:**
- Production of Fluorine-18 for PET imaging.
- Creation of other radionuclides for various diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

#### **Nuclear Reactors in Radiopharmacy**

**What are Nuclear Reactors?**
In the context of radiopharmacy, nuclear reactors are facilities that initiate, control, and sustain nuclear fission reactions, producing a slew of radionuclides in the process.

**How Do Nuclear Reactors Work?**
A reactor uses controlled fission reactions of enriched Uranium-235 or other fissile materials. As these atoms split, they release energy and a variety of radionuclides.

#### 🎛 **Generators in Radiopharmacy**

**What are Generators? 🤔**
In radiopharmacy, a generator is a system that allows for the production of a short-lived daughter radionuclide from a longer-lived parent radionuclide. The daughter radionuclide is then used in medical applications, especially when it has a short half-life and cannot be easily transported from a central production facility to hospitals or imaging centers.

**How Do Generators Work? 🔄**
The generator contains a parent radionuclide that decays into a daughter radionuclide. Once the daughter is formed, it can be extracted or "eluted" from the generator using an appropriate solvent (usually saline solution). This process is often referred to as "milking" the generator.
